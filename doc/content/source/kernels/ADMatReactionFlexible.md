# ADMatReactionFlexible

!syntax description /Kernels/ADMatReactionFlexible

## Overview

This class adds to the residual a contribution from

\begin{equation}
\frac{dc_0}{dt} = \alpha K \prod_{i}{c_i}
\end{equation}

where $c_i$ are species concentrations provided as nonlinear or coupled variables, $\alpha$ is a constant coefficient, and $K$ is a material property. $\alpha$ can be used to include the stoichiometry of a reaction for specific species. For example, for a reaction such as
\begin{equation}
X \rightarrow 2Y,
\end{equation}
$K$ would be the same for both species, but $\alpha$ would be defined as `-1` for species X, and as `2` for species Y.
