# ver-1jb

Two problems ([ver-1ja](ver-1ja.md) and ver-1jb) demonstrate tritium decay, though any other isotope could have been chosen.
The first ([ver-1ja](ver-1ja.md)) is simple decay of mobile species in a slab.
The second (ver-1jb) is decay of trapped atoms in a similar slab but with a distributed trap concentration.
This page presents ver-1jb.

ver-1jb has not yet been merged in TMAP8. Stay tuned.
