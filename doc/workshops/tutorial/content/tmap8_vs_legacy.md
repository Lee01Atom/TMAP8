# TMAP8 vs Legacy TMAP (TMAP4, TMAP7)

- TMAP8 directly inherits all of MOOSE's features

  - Easy to use and customize
  - Takes advantage of high performance computing by default
  - Developed and supported by full time INL staff - long-term support
  - Massively parallel computation
  - Multiphysics solve capability
  - Multiscale solve capability - multiple applications can perform computation for a problem simultaneously
  - Provides high-level interface to implement customized physics, geometries, boundary conditions, and material models

    - Enables 2D and 3D simulations

  - The capabilities/physics in TMAP4 are added to TMAP8
  - The addition of TMAP7 capabilities are in progress
